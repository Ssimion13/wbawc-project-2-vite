            I figure if you're on this site, I probably linked it to you or otherwise you were linked by someone else.
            So, for that reason, I'm just gonna try to go straight into this site and what it's all about.
            
            <i> Touhou Project 東方プロジェクト</i>.
            Wow, big surprise if you know me. I've been a fan of this franchise for almost fifteen years now, and to me 
            it's a franchise that I've liked for different reasons over the years, though it isn't because my opinions have
            shifted, it's because the more you understand of what Touhou is, the more utterly fascinating it becomes.

            Yeah. It's a franchise starring a _functionally_ all girl cast that shoot bullets and laser beams at each other.
            Yeah. It's also at its core a bullet hell franchise that is incredibly difficult.
            But what makes Touhou unique as a franchise is its ties to Shinto-Buddhism, the occult, and it's entire premise coloring every interaction in the series.

            {/* Touhou Lore */}

            Touhou takes place in "Gensokyo" (幻想郷 "Fantasy Village"), a place connected to the "Hakurei Shrine"
            in the real world. If we use the real world as our focal point, the games takes place sometime in the next
            100 years, in a modern society that rejects the existence of that which cannot be proven by science.
            In this universe, Folk tale creatures, youkai, gods, and "otherworldly creatures of yore" very much exist, but 
            as their powers and ability to exist are tied to <i> people's belief in them </i>, all these beings are forced
            to find places where they can continue to exist, and Gensokyo was created by some of the strongest youkai (eg.
            'has-power-to-bend-space-time') as a place they can continue to thrive. 

            In Touhou itself, there are over a hundred characters, but only about a dozen or so are human. Every other 
            character is either a youkai, a god, a folk tale creature, or otherwise something that has "passed into fantasy".
            Creatures that we as a society no longer believe exist. Some of these creatures are common, well known monsters
            like mermaids, vampires, and werewolves; some are monsterous humans who became youkai through tales told of them,
            like the creepy dollmaker, man eating mountain folk, witches; some are hilarious Japanese tall tales like the
            <a to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasa-obake"> Kasa Obake </a>, and some are characters so insanely powerful
            that their existence could only be described as godlike.

            Touhou explores a universe and society that exists in a world where characters who are so _absurdly powerful_
            that if they were to fight using their powers it would quite literally not only destroy the world but destroy
            all concepts of physics in the process. In the Touhou universe, arguments between these godlike creatures are not decided
            with a direct battle, but with a "Spell Card duel", where opponents use patterned, <i> named </i> attacks designed to evoke the character's
            origins, powers, and personality in order to settle disputes...and they all go along with it because they're all trapped in this
            realm and better get along, lest the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine come over with her broken powers and put them
            in their place. (There's also the factor of <i> pissing off every other godlike being in Gensokyo who will also want
                to tear you apart, so you might as well throw bullets at each other. </i>)

            ...Did I mention none of these characters are human? 
            All of the characters are women in Touhou not because ZUN likes to draw women, but because if you have a franchise
            created by a single person who wants to have as many <i> real/derived from real </i> gods as possible, and you don't want 
            to spend days thinking of how to fit certain symbols and clothes on a character to make them 'evoke' whatever being you're trying
            to evoke with your drawing of them, it's a lot easier to make individualistic clothing for women than it is for men.
            Think about it. Touhou as a franchise is too busy with its symbolism to bother with sexualizing any of the characters. 
            Unlike every "X, but with girls" franchise that has followed it, Touhou's mainline games pretty much never bring up anything to the fact
            that the characters are men or women or anything related to romance or sexuality (unless it's pertinent to the character's origin, eg. the "Youkai of the Subconscious")
            ...There's better things to do.

            Part of the franchise's appeal is that there are so many characters, and yet the characters themselves, especially on their
            first appearance, only have like, a few paragraphs of lines/character information at most. Whenever a new game is announced or released,
            the characters origins and powers are often left for the community to figure out as a whole -- some characters have had their official portrayals
            so far shifted by 'fan perception' that it is often very difficult to reconcile the 'popular' view of a character from their official representation.
            And all of this is intentional. What better way to emphasize the ephemeral nature of characters of tall tales and fantasy than to have their stories and 
            portrayal vary so differently between different storytellers? 

            One of the biggest reasons for Touhou's success as a franchise is due to how loose it's copyright is relative to other franchises.
            Basically, as long as you're not making (commercial money) off Touhou without permission (selling at cons and the like is OK) and you don't post the official endings of games
            online, you're in the clear. And since the endings of the games are only viewable if you beat the game without continues, it creates an extra layer of 'truth' for characters, stories, and plots
            that persists within all derivative work of Touhou. 

            
            This site is for myself more than anyone -- I wanted a place where I could place little things I've found and examples of the symbolism I've been talking about.
            It might be kinda boring, it might just be nonsense, but it'll be fun for me to make.
